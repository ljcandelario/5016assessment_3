Assessment 3 Research repository
This repository will be used as a research repository for some of my practice code.

This repository contains python code files that I have accumulated from studying python through Whitecliffe School of technology and Codecademy.
I will continue to add to this repository as I go along and learn more about using Python. This repository has been a great tool in collecting all of the code that I have been working on. It lets me see my progress and it is also a great reference point for problems and possible solutions in the future. 

It has a help desk ticketing system, using classes and methods, that I made for the software development project for Whitecliffe.
